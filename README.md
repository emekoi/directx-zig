# directx-zig

Zig bindings to (all?) of DirectX9+. It includes a Zig API to all supported interfaces so methods can be called directly on the interface instances. Yes porting COM interfaces to Zig was painful. Extremely painful. There are almost certainly errors in here, mostly type errors, so if you find one please report it.
